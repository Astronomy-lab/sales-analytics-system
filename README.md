## Files Explanation

### 1. file_handler.py

This file is used for **reading and cleaning sales file**.

Functions inside this file:

* `read_sales_data()` – reads data from text file<br>
* `parse_transactions()` – converts raw lines into dictionary<br>
* `validate_and_filter()` – remove invalid data and filter by region or amount<br>

This file mostly work with **file handling** and **string split**.<br>

### 2. data_processor.py

This file do all **calculation and analysis**.

Functions included:

* Calculate total revenue
* Region wise sales
* Top selling products
* Low performing products
* Customer analysis
* Daily sales trend
* Peak sales day
* Generate final report

All logic is written in very simple way using loops and dictionary.

### 3. api_handler.py

This file connect sales data with **DummyJSON API**.

Work of this file:

* Fetch product list from API
* Match ProductID with API product id
* Add category, brand and rating in sales data
* Save enriched data in file

This help to understand **basic API calling using requests module**.

### 4. main.py

This is the **main program file**.

This file do following steps:

1. Read sales data
2. Parse and clean data
3. Ask user for filter option
4. Do analysis
5. Fetch API data
6. Enrich sales data
